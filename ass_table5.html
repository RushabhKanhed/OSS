                <h2>  Web Development  </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web)
                        or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of
                        plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
                        A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web design, web content
                        development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration,
                        and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects
                        of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of content
                        management systems or CMS. These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary (such as Open Text) or open source (such as Drupal).
                        In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware between the database and the user through the browser. A principle benefit of a CMS
                        is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their Web site without having technical knowledge.[1] For larger
                        organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard
                        methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting
                        developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer and/or information systems technician.
                        Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department.
